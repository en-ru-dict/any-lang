# any-lang
A minimal, dependency-free JavaScript library for translating static HTML pages directly in the browser. It replaces marked strings (e.g., `[·Text·]`) with their translations defined in a simple text dictionary. Designed for small sites without frameworks, it works with plain HTML/CSS/JS files on any hosting, requiring no build steps .
